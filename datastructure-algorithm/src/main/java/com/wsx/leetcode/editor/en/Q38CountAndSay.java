//The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five ter
//ms as following: 
//
// 
//1.     1
//2.     11
//3.     21
//4.     1211
//5.     111221
// 
//
// 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11. 
//11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21. 
//21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211. 
//
// Given an integer n where 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-s
//ay sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member 
//read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. 
//
//
// Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string. 
//
//
// 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: 1
//Output: "1"
//Explanation: This is the base case.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: 4
//Output: "1211"
//Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "
//1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same wa
//y "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which
// is "1211".
